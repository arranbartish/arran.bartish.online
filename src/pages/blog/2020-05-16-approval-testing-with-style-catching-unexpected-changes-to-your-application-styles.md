  Evolving frontend applications can often diverge from a static UX style guide
  or from the original implementation. This unintentional divergence can cause
  disappointment, rework, and in the worst cases, a breakdown of trust between
  disciplines in teams. Catching these unexpected changes to your styles can be
  done without a lot of effort as part of your build pipeline. Unexpected rework
  and regression can be reduced with clear identification of the “breaking”
  change which can be used as the beginning of a valuable conversation. We’ll
  explore some of the off the shelf components you can use to integrate approval
  testing into your visual regression suite.
