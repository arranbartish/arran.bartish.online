  Engineering software is hard and it's even harder when you don't have the
  freedom and confidence to make major changes to your application. Even those
  of us that might have amazing automation protection could find themselves in
  the awful position where a change could turn your tests from friends to
  enemies as they all go red. There are engineering patterns that when employed
  can help keep your test suites friendly. I'll be exploring some of them here.

**Message:** Well engineered tests are critical to ensuring that your production code remains maintainable. 

It can happen that when code is regularly refactored you can get the feedback equivalent of a Christmas tree, all green and red, probably mostly green

Use of good patterns can help ensure that t

**I am passionate about this because** tests can become an impediment and people blame the tests instead of the grassroots engineering decisions that we not made when building them.
