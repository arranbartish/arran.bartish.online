### A real person

I am an Australian Canadian and live in Canada, near Montreal, with my wife and three daughters. Originally born and raised in Australia, much of my early adulthood was spent in the United Kingdom. I often draw metaphors from obscure movie references, bonus points if you spot them.

#### Things I love

* hanging out with my family
* reading
* Sci-Fi
* computers
* movies

### Education

I completed a graduate and post-graduate computer science degrees (honours) at the [Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT)](https://www.rmit.edu.au/) in Melbourne, Australia.

### Career

During my travels, I have worked with many teams in Australia, Germany, Hungary, the United State, the United Kingdom, and Canada. My first engagement as a team lead was in 2001 and I have helped teams around the globe succeed ever since. 

My research work was presented at the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems conference in 2002.  I am a continuous learner and I love to share my observations and experiences with others who want to share and are eager to learn. As a result I have begun trying to write articles and give talks some of which you can find on this site.
